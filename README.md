# R Projects
This repo contains all of the projects I've done in RStudio.

## Exploring Data in the Internet Movie Database
Explore film data from one of the largest movie databases, imdb.com, creating visualizations from R base graphs to ggplot2 graphs
- Code: [MovieDataEDA.Rmd](https://github.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/blob/main/MovieDataEDA/MovieDataEDA.Rmd)
- Output: [MovieDataEDA.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/f924f20224c55caa794dbf65562310f969fa4ee2/MovieDataEDA/MovieDataEDA.html)

## Create Shiny App Visualizing Marketing Data
Create an interactive plot by building a shiny app, displaying linear regression models between 3 media advertising media's budget and sales
- Code: [ui.R](https://github.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/blob/main/ShinyApp_Regression/ui.R) & [server.R](https://github.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/blob/main/ShinyApp_Regression/server.R)
- Output: [Shiny App](https://jriggs3420.shinyapps.io/r_projects/)

## Build Multiple Linear Regression Model Using Stepwise Method
Build multiple linear regression models using the stepwise method using regsubets(). I use the forward, backward, and exhaustive methods to create a predictor model to optimize key statitics such as adjusted R-Sqaured and cross validated prediction error. These models could potentially predict the interest rate for a consumer loan made by Lending Club.
- Data: [LoansData.csv](https://github.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/blob/main/LoansData_StepwiseRegression/loansData.csv)
- Code: [LoansDataProject.R](https://github.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/blob/main/LoansData_StepwiseRegression/LoansDataProject.R)

## Apply 5 Machine Learning Algorithms to Determine Credit-Worthinness
Utilize machine learning packages within R to predict a binary response, credit- worthy or not? In this project, the methods used are logistic regression with and without LASSO, decision tree with pruning, bagging, and random forest.
- Code: [MLA_CreditData.Rmd](https://github.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/blob/main/MLA_CreditData/MLA_CreditData.Rmd)
- Output: [MLA_CreditData.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/jriggs3420/RProjects/4e83e004b875d9e1ae173a154674060901bece6b/MLA_CreditData/MLA_CreditData.html)
